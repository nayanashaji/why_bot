# WhyBot üéØ

## Basic Details

### Team Name: 01

### Team Members
- Member 1: Nayana Shaji ‚Äì GEC Thrissur

### Project Description  
**WhyBot** is a brutally honest, passive-aggressive support system that gives you everything *except* the actual solution. Ask a question, and get a tool to solve it. If a tool can't be given, then behold the advice of Shakespeare and other famous characters!

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
People are getting help way too easily. We believe solutions should be a *journey*, not a gift.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We created an "AI-Assistant" that gives you *other* tools and services to *maybe* solve your problem, eventually. Or not. Think of it like customer support, but designed by philosophers with commitment issues.
