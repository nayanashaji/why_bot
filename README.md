# WhyBot üéØ

## Basic Details

### Team Name: 01

### Team Members
- Member 1: Nayana Shaji ‚Äì GEC Thrissur

### Project Description  
**WhyBot** is a useless AI that makes solutions a journey. Ask it to fix a bug, and it provides a blueprint for a new tool to solve it. For abstract problems? You get witty advice from Shakespeare. It's the peak of over-engineering for the Useless Projects by TinkerHub¬†hackathon.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
People are getting help way too easily. We believe solutions should be a *journey*, not a gift.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We created an "AI-Assistant" that gives you *other* tools and services to *maybe* solve your problem, eventually. Or not. Think of it like customer support, but designed by philosophers with commitment issues.
